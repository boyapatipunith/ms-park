Country of Origin. Grizzly bears as we know them originated in Asia around 1.3 million years ago, evolved from Etruscan bears that appeared in Europe about 5 million years before. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) crossed the Bering land bridge some 200,000 years ago. These bears eventually developed into the grizzly bear.
