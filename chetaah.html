<p align="justify">Cheetah History. The oldest fossils place cheetahs in North America in what is now Texas, Nevada and Wyoming. Cheetahs were common throughout Asia, Africa, Europe and North America until the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, when massive climatic changes caused large numbers of mammals to disappear.
<br><br>
Cheetah Evolution. Cheetahs are special as they are the only member of the genus Acinonyx. They evolved about 5.5 million years ago along with the golden cats and pumas. Lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars evolved about 1.6 million years ago.
