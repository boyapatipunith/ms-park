<p align="justify">Evolutionary history of true crabs (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura) and the origin of freshwater crabs. ... Crabs of the infra-order Brachyura are one of the most diverse groups of crustaceans with approximately 7,000 described species in 98 families, occurring in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats.
<br><br>
The term was introduced by L. A. Borradaile, who described it as "one of the many attempts of Nature to evolve a crab". Carcinisation is believed to have occurred independently in at least five groups of decapod crustaceans, most notably king crabs, which most scientists believe evolved from hermit crab ancestors.
