<p align="justify">Crocodiles hail from the Archosaur family and they thrived in the Cretaceous period. The same period is also referred to as the Age of Reptiles. Archosaurs were among the first giant lizards that evolved during the Permian period which was sometime around 250 million years ago.

Crocodiles are the ultimate survivors. Having arisen some 200 million years ago, they have outlived the dinosaurs by some 65 million years. Even humans, the most fearsome predators ever to stalk the Earth, have failed to force into extinction any of the 23 species of crocodilians.
