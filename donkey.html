Asses were first domesticated around 3000 BC, probably in Egypt or Mesopotamia, and have spread around the world.

The domesticated donkey is believed to be the descendent of the wild ass, Equss africanus. More specifically, donkeys come from the Somali and Nubian wild asses. The first captivity of the wild ass was in Egypt and western Asia dated back as early as 2800 B.C. to 2500 B.C.
