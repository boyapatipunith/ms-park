<p align="justify">Wild ducks are excellent fliers and have also traditionally been hunted for sport and for eating. A lovely little breed of duck known as the Call Duck was used by hunters to lure in wild ducks because she had a very load and frequent quack. In more recent times though the Call Duck has become an incredibly popular garden duck because of its size, beautiful colours and shape.

Duck eggs are larger and richer than chickens' eggs which makes them popular with cooks. There are now many breeds which will lay as many eggs every year as the best chicken
