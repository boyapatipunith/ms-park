<p align="justify">We have witnessed a great story unfold before our eyes , that of the rescue of Harmon, Harmons return to the nest and the return of the parents.  This has brought to  mind a “story” that I occasionally get asked by visitors at The National Eagle Center and I have also seen it pop up in the chat room as well.   It is how when an eagle gets to be about 40 years old  and wants to live for another 30 years or more, the eagle will fly to a mountain top and go through a rebirth.
