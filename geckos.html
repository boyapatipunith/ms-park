<p align="justify">The lizard is of symbolic significance to many civilizations and cultures. ... There are also symbolic representations of the loss and the quick regeneration of the gecko's tail. It represents self protection and re-growth that humans also go through. The customary gecko circle symbolizes the natural cycle of life.

Perhaps this is the story of the early Polynesian geckos today. Their gentle wisdom overpowered too often, they are withdrawing to the forests and the quiet rivers far away. They are worth listening to, these magical lizards. They bring good luck, they say.
