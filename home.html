<p align="justify">Zoos do much more than provide recreation, however. They teach people about the importance of nature. They provide scientists with opportunities to study wild animals. And they are also important because thousands of species of wild animals are in danger of dying out.
<br><br>
Having a good zoo is the key to making sure that animals are kept in a healthy environment. In order to have a good sense of conservation, zoos need proper funding. Most zoos lack the financial resources to support conservation. ... Linehan adds that zoo animals are not domesticated.
<br><br>
So a good zoo will provide great care and protection to animals in their care. ... A good number of species only exist in captivity and still more only exist in the wild because they have been reintroduced from zoos, or the wild populations have been boosted by captive bred animals.
