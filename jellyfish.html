<p align="justify">Jellyfish have no bones, so fossils are hard to come by. Nevertheless, scientists have evidence that these creatures have been bobbing along in the world's oceans for at least 500 million years. In fact, it's likely that the jellyfish lineage goes back even further, possibly 700 million years or longer.
