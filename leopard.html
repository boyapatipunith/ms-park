<p align="justify">Leopard: Natural History Notebooks. Found throughout most of Africa and Asia, the leopard inhabits a variety of regions, such as tropical forests, brush and scrublands, rocky hillsides and even the high, cold slopes of the Himalayas. Powerful and agile, the leopard is an efficient hunter.

Poaching for skin and body parts, persecution by humans, and habitat loss have threatened the lives of these leopards. A 2014 survey indicated that there are around 12,000 to 14,000 leopards existing in the wild today.
