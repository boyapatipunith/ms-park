<p align="justify">Nearly all wild lions live in sub-Saharan Africa, but one small population of Asiatic lions exists in India's Gir Forest. Asiatic lions and African lions are subspecies of the same species. Asiatic lions once prowled from the Middle East to India.

African lions are the most social of all big cats and live together in groups or “prides.” A pride consists of about 15 lions. ... Male lions defend the pride's territory while females do most of the hunting. Despite this, the males eat first.
