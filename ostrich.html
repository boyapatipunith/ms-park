<p align="justify">Approximately 20-60 million years ago, ostriches were found around the Mediterranean Sea in the west, China in the east and Mongolia in the north. Together with many other large mammals, ostriches only migrated south across Africa about a million years ago. Itâ€™s a well-documented fact that large ostriches were already roaming the Western Cape at the time of the landing of Jan van Riebeeck in 1652.
