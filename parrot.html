<p align="justify">The first record of a parrot being kept as a pet in the British Isles is 1504, when Prince Henry Tudor, later Henry VIII, took possession of an African Grey. Parrots had been kept as pets long before this, however, in their native countries, particularly the pacific islands and South America. There is evidence that the bird was being kept in Brazil 5,000 years ago; India 3,000 years ago; Egypt 2,000 years ago; and China 1800 years ago.
Alexander the Great brought pet Ring-necked Parakeets to Greece in 327BC, and the Alexandrine Parakeet was named after him. The Romans were fond of the birds too, and many were kept in the Empire (although there is no record of pet Roman parrots in Britain). Pliny the Elder, writing in 77BC, instructs owners to hit the birds on the head to encourage them to speak â€“ definitely a piece of advice to ignore!
