<p align="justify">Proterocheris is another ancient fossil turtle that lived at the same time as Proganochelys. ... In tracing back the history of the other turtle suborder, Cryptodira, Kayentachelys aprix of the Late Jurassic (some 150 million years ago) is almost assuredly a cryptodire; it is also the oldest known North American turtle.
<br><br>
In comparison, the evolution of humankind can be traced back to only 2.5 million years. The oldest turtle fossil discovered to date was unearthed only as recently as 2007 in China's Guizhou province. It was estimated to be 220 million years old, was an aquatic turtle and given the name Odontochelys semistestacea.
