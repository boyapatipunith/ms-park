<p align="justify"> The largest creature ever known to have existed on Earth is the present-day blue whale. Today's blue whale is even larger than its prehistoric ancestors, reaching a total length of 30 m (100 ft.) and a weight of 136 t (150 tn.).
<br><br>
Blue whales are the largest animals ever known to have lived on Earth. These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to 100 feet long and upwards of 200 tons. Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant. Their hearts, as much as an automobile.
